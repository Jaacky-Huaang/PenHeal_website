        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity defenses against sophisticated threats. LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities. Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities. This paper introduces <em>PenHeal</em>, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies. The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that <em>PenHeal</em> not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models. These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.</p>
